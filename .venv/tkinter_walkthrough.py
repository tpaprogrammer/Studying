"""This tutorial uses the '.pack()' method. There are three methods:
        - .place()  -> coordinate-based placement of each object
            - This method is invoked from within the widget's object,
            not the window, as the widget is always aware of the window
            it belongs to due to the constructor's first argument.
        - .grid()   -> distribution of widgets is modeled inside the
        manager
            - You are only able to view the final arrangement.
            - You do not need to declare the number of rows and columns
            in advance, the method identifies what is needed.
        - .pack()   -> packs subsequent widgets, in order, into the
        window's interior
            - Quickest, but 'sloppiest' and least intuitive.

The 'fill' argument is used in the .pack() geometry manager, not
directly in the button constructor. It specifies how a widget should
expand to fill the available space in its container (parent widget).

Hereâ€™s how the fill argument works:

fill='x': The widget will expand horizontally to fill the width of its
    container.
fill='y': The widget will expand vertically to fill the height of its
    container.
fill='both': The widget will expand both horizontally and vertically to
    fill the entire space of its container.
fill=None (default): The widget will not expand in any direction.

"""Create a Switch object.

The switch below is designed to hold an IntVar class object, which is
designed to store inger values. A regular variable cannot be used.
IntVar objects are used by TKinter to organize internal communication
between different widgets.

Other examples of what can be used within a switch (per Bing) include
a BooleanVar for binary states, Direct State Management (No Variable)
and a custom class or function.

The switch below is referenced by both the following CheckButton and
RadioButton objects. As a result, checking/unchecking the CheckButton
also and unavoidably changes the RadioButtons' state(s) and vice versa.
To control separate widgets, additional switches would be used.
